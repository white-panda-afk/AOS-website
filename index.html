                        Focus on the journey not on the destination, as joy is found not in finishing an activity but in
                        doing it. I feel quite humble and elated at the same time on being assigned the National
                        Co-ordinator for Asian Olympiad Society(AOS), I thank Dr. Adrish Brahmadutta for giving me this
                        noble opportunity. The work of me and my team members are well recognized in the field of
                        education and we have constantly strived for excellence since our inception. We consider our
                        students the torchbearers of the country’s future and thus aim to construct the future of the
                        nation through these young intellectuals. with the love, support and trust. hope all our members
                        ,students and parents will continue to strive hard for proper management of this noble
                        work.”Children are like buds in a garden and should be carefully and lovingly nurtured, as they
                        are the future of the nation and the citizens of tomorrow.” My main motto would be to give
                        justice to the students those who are appearing these exams, As we know that success is not an
                        accident, it is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of
                        what you are doing or learning to do. I know they are working hard in tune with their parents
                        and leaving no stone unturned in their endeavor, I heartily appreciate this. As I am personally
                        involved with them, I can feel their emotions, their frustrations when they are misinterpreted
                        and underestimated, and also their elation and joy on achieving success. Needless to say
                        enriching the quality of education shall be our constant endeavor in future .If at all any
                        changes occur they will without any doubt aim at the betterment of our student’s future.
                        Wishing all the very best.
                        Thanks and regards
